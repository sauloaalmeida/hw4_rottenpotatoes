# Add a declarative step here for populating the DB with movies.

Given /the following movies exist/ do |movies_table|
  movies_table.hashes.each do |movie|
    Movie.create!(movie)
  end
end

Then /the director of "(.*)" should be "(.*)"/ do |movie,director|
    assert director.eql?(Movie.find_by_title(movie).director)
end
